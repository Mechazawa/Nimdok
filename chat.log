[12-20 20:50:40] #/g/sicp Petit_Dejeuner: chchjesus, When I was a young boy my parents sent me off to a boarding school and father never allowed me to come home.
[12-20 20:51:07] #/g/sicp Petit_Dejeuner: Then the love of my life left me and my business partner died.
[12-20 20:52:04] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Petit_Dejeuner: Really?
[12-20 20:52:12] #/g/sicp antix: no cheech

[12-20 20:52:28] #/g/sicp Petit_Dejeuner: or part of it anyway
[12-20 20:52:28] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I was kinda skeptical at business partner
[12-20 20:52:45] #/g/sicp chchjesus: and the fact that you used the words "love of my life"
[12-20 20:52:53] #/g/sicp chchjesus: instead of >tfw no gf
[12-20 20:52:54] #/g/sicp Petit_Dejeuner: chchjesus, I could just be a dumb teenager.

[12-20 20:55:42] #/g/sicp chchjesus: The only problem here is that I'm consulting strangers off the internet who will probably give me lewd things to say

[12-20 22:58:29] #/g/sicp antix: doesn't the cooler come with already-applied paste?
[12-20 22:58:58] #/g/sicp phrodo: no man
[12-20 22:59:03] #/g/sicp phrodo: you need to put the paste on the CPU
[12-20 22:59:11] #/g/sicp phrodo: man
[12-20 22:59:15] #/g/sicp phrodo: man
[12-20 22:59:24] #/g/sicp phrodo: am i supposed to apply paste to the heatsink
[12-20 22:59:38] #/g/sicp antix: it already comes with paste, you doofus.
[12-20 22:59:42] #/g/sicp phrodo: i c
[12-20 22:59:43] #/g/sicp antix: if it's the stock cooler.
[12-20 22:59:50] #/g/sicp phrodo: is there such thing as too much thermal paste
[12-20 22:59:52] #/g/sicp antix: cooler/heatsink
[12-20 22:59:56] #/g/sicp antix: yes there is.
[12-20 23:00:07] #/g/sicp phrodo: some idiot on a forum said he ruined his CPU by emptying the paste onto it
[12-20 23:00:10] #/g/sicp antix: just apply like 4 dots on it and sit the heatsink.
[12-20 23:00:17] #/g/sicp phrodo: man its fine
[12-20 23:00:18] #/g/sicp antix: don't spread it out yourself.
[12-20 23:00:22] #/g/sicp phrodo: what antix 
[12-20 23:00:29] #/g/sicp phrodo: i watched a youtube video and i spread it
[12-20 23:00:34] #/g/sicp antix: lol
[12-20 23:01:23] #/g/sicp phrodo: man
[12-20 23:01:28] #/g/sicp phrodo: does it spread itself antix 
[12-20 23:01:33] #/g/sicp antix: yeah.
[12-20 23:01:41] #/g/sicp phrodo: what if it overflows
[12-20 23:02:03] #/g/sicp antix: like you know how when you make smores and you [put the marshmallow between the cookies?
[12-20 23:02:07] #/g/sicp antix: you [ress it and spreads itself evenly.
[12-20 23:02:15] #/g/sicp antix: think of the cpu and heatsink as the cookies
[12-20 23:02:21] #/g/sicp phrodo: i c
[12-20 23:02:24] #/g/sicp antix: and the paste as a toxic marshmallow
[12-20 23:02:44] #/g/sicp antix: but if you alread yput it/spread it, don't worry.
[12-20 23:02:57] #/g/sicp antix: unless you applied too little or too much, you won't really see a difference.
[12-20 23:02:59] #/g/sicp phrodo: its probably fine
[12-20 23:03:03] #/g/sicp phrodo: man
[12-20 23:03:09] #/g/sicp phrodo: i'll just add more if my cpu overheats
[12-20 23:03:13] #/g/sicp antix: lol
[12-20 23:03:27] #/g/sicp Datsundere: don't spread it
[12-20 23:03:28] #/g/sicp Datsundere: are you a slut?
[12-20 23:03:47] #/g/sicp phrodo: its what the youtube video said to do
[12-20 23:03:49] #/g/sicp Datsundere: if you spread it, you will get all sort so of air bubbles
[12-20 23:03:52] #/g/sicp Datsundere: and holes
[12-20 23:04:08] #/g/sicp phrodo: man
[12-20 23:04:12] #/g/sicp phrodo: it should be fine Datsundere 
[12-20 23:04:19] #/g/sicp Datsundere: if you say so
[12-20 23:04:27] #/g/sicp phrodo: its too late now
[12-20 23:05:09] #/g/sicp antix: did you apply the anti-rust grease on the capacitors btw?
[12-20 23:05:15] #/g/sicp antix: if not you might be screwed.
[12-20 23:06:14] #/g/sicp phrodo: yea nice try antix theres no such thing as anti rust grease or capacitators
[12-20 23:06:37] #/g/sicp antix: :|
[12-20 23:06:55] #/g/sicp antix: your butt has grease.
[12-20 23:07:02] #/g/sicp Datsundere: I just go raw on my cpu and heat sink
[12-20 23:07:06] #/g/sicp Datsundere: don't need any protection
[12-20 23:07:26] #/g/sicp antix: that's what he said.
[12-20 23:07:48] #/g/sicp antix: btw Datsundere that's actually somewhat possible now, since Intel actually puts paste *inside* the CPU.
[12-20 23:07:59] #/g/sicp antix: well, not "inside" but betwee nthe die and the metal cover.
[12-20 23:08:26] #/g/sicp Datsundere: interesting
[12-20 23:08:47] #/g/sicp Datsundere: so like carbon fiber condoms
[12-20 23:09:25] #/g/sicp Datsundere: I hate working on template design with xml
[12-20 23:09:33] #/g/sicp Datsundere: first of all, I don't know what I'm doing
[12-20 23:10:44] #/g/sicp antix: it's not that common right now, but I remember back in the C2D/C2Q days people use to like, grind the top of the CPU
[12-20 23:10:46] #/g/sicp antix: can't remember the term for it.
[12-20 23:11:06] #/g/sicp antix: lapping!
[12-20 23:11:23] #/g/sicp antix: you lapped your CPU and the put the cooler on. you got better temperatures.
[12-20 23:11:32] #/g/sicp antix: people would go nuts with the Q6600
[12-20 23:13:09] #/g/sicp Datsundere: wow

[12-21 01:52:33] #/g/sicp antix: NSA paid the RSA
[12-21 01:53:02] #/g/sicp antix: you know what? I feel like changing my major
[12-21 01:53:07] #/g/sicp chchjesus: antix: I thought you said NSA paid the NSA for a second
[12-21 01:53:08] #/g/sicp antix: something like law
[12-21 01:53:14] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Also law is boring man
[12-21 01:53:24] #/g/sicp antix: but I want to change the world :/
[12-21 01:54:35] #/g/sicp antix: >Undisclosed until now was that RSA received $10 million in a deal that set the NSA formula as the preferred, or default, method for number generation in the BSafe software, according to two sources familiar with the contract. 
[12-21 01:54:51] #/g/sicp antix: also interesting comment
[12-21 01:54:53] #/g/sicp antix: I'm starting to get the feeling that this is really, really, gonna fuck up our economy.
[12-21 01:54:55] #/g/sicp antix: Once it is time to start renewing contracts, why would anyone trust a US based company?
[12-21 01:57:17] #/g/sicp chchjesus: ikr
[12-21 01:57:30] #/g/sicp chchjesus: And I wonder what else Snowden hasn't revealed yet
[12-21 01:57:41] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Like, there's probably a lot more shocking stuff to come
[12-21 01:57:49] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Perhaps stuff that could cause civil unrest
[12-21 01:58:12] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Or break down some internal US trust relationships
[12-21 01:58:20] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Hopefully it cripples the country
[12-21 01:59:03] #/g/sicp antix: he mentioned something like that.
[12-21 01:59:11] #/g/sicp antix: and only ~1% of the things have been published.
[12-21 01:59:22] #/g/sicp antix: I  hope it's not a super longterm plan like Wikileaks' 
[12-21 01:59:52] #/g/sicp antix: Wikileaks' current cables are planned tofinish being revealed in 300 years time.
[12-21 01:59:59] #/g/sicp antix: ain't nobody got time for htat.
[12-21 02:00:31] #/g/sicp chchjesus: That's wonderful antix
[12-21 02:00:36] #/g/sicp chchjesus: By trickling it out
[12-21 02:00:42] #/g/sicp chchjesus: They're keeping us concerned
[12-21 02:00:45] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Also
[12-21 02:01:01] #/g/sicp chchjesus: You are right in that 300 years is a little bit too long
[12-21 02:02:53] #/g/sicp antix: yes, it makes sense, really.
[12-21 02:03:10] #/g/sicp antix: if they pulled it all out immediately, the news would only report once and forget about it.
[12-21 02:03:14] #/g/sicp antix: which is NOT GOOD.
[12-21 02:03:26] #/g/sicp antix: but by releasing slowly, one by one, you can process information better.
[12-21 02:03:31] #/g/sicp antix: chew it out, savor it.
[12-21 02:03:39] #/g/sicp antix: the problem is the media reporting it :p
[12-21 02:03:50] #/g/sicp antix: Greenwald's project cannot come soon enough.

[12-21 02:52:40] #/g/sicp chchjesus: spock man
[12-21 02:52:42] #/g/sicp spock: man you cant do that in australia antix , the internet isnt good enough
[12-21 02:52:49] #/g/sicp antix: right, sorry.
[12-21 02:53:02] #/g/sicp antix: do you have data caps spock?
[12-21 02:53:03] #/g/sicp chchjesus: This is your chance to free yourself from the shackles of Windows, and move to Linux.
[12-21 02:53:14] #/g/sicp spock: no man i need excel and video games
[12-21 02:53:34] #/g/sicp chchjesus: spock: That's a very weak argument. You can use R.
[12-21 02:53:39] #/g/sicp chchjesus: And there is steam on Linux.
[12-21 02:53:44] #/g/sicp chchjesus: You don't even play video games
[12-21 02:53:47] #/g/sicp chchjesus: You gamble all day
[12-21 02:53:50] #/g/sicp antix: haha R is cool.
[12-21 02:53:53] #/g/sicp antix: but Julia is best.
[12-21 02:54:04] #/g/sicp spock: no R is for statistical analysis, i need spreadsheets too man
[12-21 02:54:29] #/g/sicp spock: and R works on windwos
[12-21 02:54:33] #/g/sicp antix: I bet spock might end up like that mom in "my mum tries ___ distor" series on youtube.
[12-21 02:54:49] #/g/sicp chchjesus: But so what spock, you could be using Linux as well
[12-21 02:54:56] #/g/sicp chchjesus: It doesn't matter what R can be used on
[12-21 02:55:02] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Also
[12-21 02:55:18] #/g/sicp chchjesus: OpenOffice and LibreOffce both have spreadsheet editors that are just as good as MS Office's
[12-21 02:55:25] #/g/sicp spock: no its not
[12-21 02:55:30] #/g/sicp spock: its good as maybe 2003 office

[12-21 02:55:57] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Maybe one day spock 
[12-21 02:56:03] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Maybe one day you will realise
[12-21 02:56:23] #/g/sicp antix: you can't be serious. LO/OO.org don't even come CLOSE to Excell.
[12-21 02:56:30] #/g/sicp chchjesus: lel
[12-21 02:56:30] #/g/sicp antix: it's on a league of its on, sadly.
[12-21 02:56:33] #/g/sicp antix: own*
[12-21 02:57:01] #/g/sicp antix: but tbh unless you're hardcore, you won't use many of the features.
[12-21 02:57:04] #/g/sicp chchjesus: antix: You can't seriously use all of those extra features that MS Excel provices
[12-21 02:57:07] #/g/sicp chchjesus: provides*
[12-21 02:57:11] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Exactly
[12-21 02:57:23] #/g/sicp chchjesus: That's why you only need a simple spreadsheet
[12-21 02:57:32] #/g/sicp antix: maybe spock works for a Fortune 500 company
[12-21 02:57:39] #/g/sicp antix: and he needs all that stuff.
[12-21 02:57:44] #/g/sicp chchjesus: spock doesn't go outside

[12-21 04:45:23] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I wonder if he's online right now
[12-21 04:45:33] #/g/sicp Tadpole: I think I fixed a bug somewhere and made the roulette module twice as big.
[12-21 04:45:51] #/g/sicp Tadpole: It's now a mini-rpg, get 3 kills and you level up to semi-automatic.
[12-21 04:45:52] #/g/sicp bas_: I'm gonna go to the gym

[12-21 04:46:30] #/g/sicp Tadpole: chchjesus: Yeah that caused like an hour of uncessant botspam.
[12-21 04:46:31] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Tadpole: Before then, SICPBot's roulette module didn't work on me but it did for other people. I was great. Then you had to go and fix it.
[12-21 04:46:48] #/g/sicp chchjesus: It like, never banned me
[12-21 04:46:55] #/g/sicp Tadpole: Just for you, chchjesus ;)

[12-21 04:48:07] #/g/sicp Tadpole: If you're bored, try and write a proper auth module.
[12-21 04:48:50] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I've already got some plans for a new module
[12-21 04:49:00] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Also

[12-21 04:55:31] #/g/sicp chchjesus: You guys, just wait
[12-21 04:55:56] #/g/sicp chchjesus: SICPBot has been overhauled and the new thread searching module can search fast
[12-21 04:56:14] #/g/sicp chchjesus: And it can search the whole board
[12-21 04:57:11] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Maybe we should start a new SICPBot in Go

[12-21 05:26:50] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I should do that
[12-21 05:29:13] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I'm going to set up streaming on it tonight
[12-21 05:29:20] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I-I swear!
[12-21 05:34:18] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Also
[12-21 05:34:26] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Have any of you guys used midnight commander?
[12-21 05:35:05] #/g/sicp Tadpole: briefly
[12-21 05:35:37] #/g/sicp chchjesus: You didn't like it?
[12-21 05:36:11] #/g/sicp Tadpole: Didn't see the point
[12-21 05:37:36] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Ah.
[12-21 05:37:39] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I've never been a fan of mc either
[12-21 05:37:43] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Very DOS-ish
[12-21 05:37:51] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Maybe that's why my colleague likes it
[12-21 05:38:05] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: i.e. if you're using it it's either because you're forced to or too stupid to know about the better alternatives
[12-21 05:38:57] #/g/sicp chchjesus: LAMMJohnson: You use fetchmail right?
[12-21 05:39:02] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes
[12-21 05:39:07] #/g/sicp chchjesus: ok
[12-21 05:39:48] #/g/sicp lolimania: http://rbt.asia/g/thread/38947020 wtf is this?
[12-21 05:39:57] #/g/sicp chchjesus: So, your VPS runs postfix to handle sending and receiving mail, and you run fetchmail to fetch it from your VPS
[12-21 05:40:03] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Is this correct LAMMJohnson?
[12-21 05:40:05] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes
[12-21 05:40:50] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: PM me your email address and public key? I'll send you an email so you can see how a man does it.
[12-21 05:41:20] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I don't yet have a public key
[12-21 05:41:31] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: gpg --gen-key
[12-21 05:41:36] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: It's 10 seconds of work
[12-21 05:41:41] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I don't have gpg installed
[12-21 05:42:14] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Son I am disappoint
[12-21 05:42:22] #/g/sicp chchjesus: hang on
[12-21 05:42:26] #/g/sicp chchjesus: sudo apt-get install gpg
[12-21 05:42:30] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: 4177k
[12-21 05:42:51] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Might be under gnupg
[12-21 05:43:03] #/g/sicp chchjesus: It us
[12-21 05:43:07] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Woah
[12-21 05:43:15] #/g/sicp chchjesus: It was already installed
[12-21 05:43:21] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Must've been installed with postfix
[12-21 05:43:26] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Nope
[12-21 05:43:38] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Debian actually has a proper package manager that requires packages to be signed
[12-21 05:43:38] #/g/sicp lolimania: i thought it comes preinstalled with most distros
[12-21 05:44:39] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I run ubuntu
[12-21 05:44:51] #/g/sicp chchjesus: It got installed on my local machine but didn't need to be installed on my VPS
[12-21 06:05:48] #/g/sicp chchjesus: antix: What did you say could be good for streaming?
[12-21 06:09:39] #/g/sicp chchjesus: nvm
[12-21 06:09:44] #/g/sicp chchjesus: If luz could work it out
[12-21 06:09:47] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I will work it out
[12-21 06:12:20] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: chchjesus: go on, then. Lets get your GPG all sorted out.
[12-21 06:12:25] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Have you generated your key?
[12-21 06:13:02] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: If you choose all the default options you'll generate an RSA key pair for encryption/decryption and one for signing.
[12-21 06:14:08] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I have generated my key
[12-21 06:14:20] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I'm not going to bother with mail stuff just get
[12-21 06:14:28] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I intend to do my streaming first
[12-21 06:14:29] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Sure
[12-21 06:14:48] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Although it's not just for mail, of course.
[12-21 06:14:56] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I know, I know.
[12-21 06:14:58] #/g/sicp chchjesus: lol
[12-21 06:15:05] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I'm actually looking at transmission's cli right now
[12-21 06:15:10] #/g/sicp chchjesus: So I can download onto my PS
[12-21 06:15:12] #/g/sicp chchjesus: VPS*
[12-21 06:15:19] #/g/sicp chchjesus: and then stream through livestream
[12-21 06:15:27] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Hmmm
[12-21 06:15:37] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Maybe I should use something like justin.tv 
[12-21 06:15:43] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: alias trr='transmission-remote'
[12-21 06:15:51] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I do a ton of transmission stuff
[12-21 06:15:52] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Good idea.
[12-21 06:16:13] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I want to be able to stream movies so #/g/sicp can watch movies together
[12-21 06:16:46] #/g/sicp chchjesus: My biggest concern is being hit with a copyright infringement notice for streaming
[12-21 06:17:00] #/g/sicp chchjesus: and I have a nasty suspicion that a service such as livestream will do just that
[12-21 06:17:24] #/g/sicp chchjesus: However, that would save on my bandwidth
[12-21 06:17:36] #/g/sicp chchjesus: a service such as livestream, that is
[12-21 06:17:42] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I only get a TB per month
[12-21 06:18:32] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Oh
[12-21 06:18:36] #/g/sicp chchjesus: 1TB is fine
[12-21 06:18:38] #/g/sicp chchjesus: actuall
[12-21 06:18:46] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Fuck it
[12-21 06:18:51] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I'll just stream from my VPS
[12-21 06:23:13] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Lemme enable HTTPS irst
[12-21 06:23:27] #/g/sicp chchjesus: s/enable/force s/irst/first
[12-21 06:24:33] #/g/sicp anonnumberanon: yeah, do that
[12-21 06:27:49] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Then I shall whip up a quick webserver to require a simple login
[12-21 06:28:20] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Oh, that might not be necessary if you guys can stream to your computers correct?
[12-21 06:32:46] #/g/sicp anonnumberanon: Come on, the portal is not gonna build itself!
[12-21 06:41:41] #/g/sicp bas_: Okay I'm gonna go shop for xmass gifts. PLEASE don't make Nimdok crash :< I'm gonna rewrite him today but for now he's just a ghost in the shell
[12-21 06:45:14] #/g/sicp anonnumberanon: Actually, the bot might hurts us.
[12-21 06:45:25] #/g/sicp bas_: because he's a ghost?
[12-21 06:48:43] #/g/sicp chchjesus: LAMMJohnson: Yoy there?
[12-21 06:48:57] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: chchjesus: I have to nip out for half an our real quick
[12-21 06:49:07] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I gotta get some sleep
[12-21 06:49:13] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I was just going to ask about MX records
[12-21 06:49:37] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: They're simple. Anyone here should be able to help you.

[12-21 12:49:59] #/g/sicp lolimania: ShameOnATrip: it teaches scheme
[12-21 12:50:14] #/g/sicp lolimania: which is a dialect of lisp
[12-21 12:50:35] #/g/sicp ShameOnATrip: Is it worth learning or should I just read it to get a better handle on thinking like a programmer
[12-21 12:50:54] #/g/sicp lolimania: are you using windows?
[12-21 12:51:16] #/g/sicp antix: ShameOnATrip: yes it's Lisp.

[12-21 12:51:58] #/g/sicp antix: keep in mind that the book is very time consuming.
[12-21 12:52:12] #/g/sicp antix: not necessarily hard per se, but will make you think.
[12-21 12:52:14] #/g/sicp ShameOnATrip: I have a lot of time these days
[12-21 12:52:15] #/g/sicp lolimania: then ditch your games too

[12-21 15:49:01] #/g/sicp agaric: btw a hint, don't, and I mean don't eat a whole box of chocolates for your breakfest
[12-21 15:49:09] #/g/sicp Longlius: I've forgotten which part of the world you're from...
[12-21 15:49:31] #/g/sicp Longlius: gah, custom vhost has foiled my whois

[12-21 15:49:55] #/g/sicp Longlius: a whole box of chocolates?
[12-21 15:49:59] #/g/sicp Longlius: that's way too much chocolate
[12-21 15:50:23] #/g/sicp agaric: it is for a breakfest, else not so much...
[12-21 15:50:46] #/g/sicp Longlius: I guess it depends on the chocolate too
[12-21 15:50:48] #/g/sicp agaric: chocholate is my crack
[12-21 15:51:08] #/g/sicp Longlius: like, if it's like American milk chocolate, a whole box would be too much, but darker varieties would be okay
[12-21 15:51:28] #/g/sicp Longlius: and then I guess it depends on the presence of fillings
[12-21 15:51:46] #/g/sicp Longlius: coconut is best filling, all years
[12-21 15:51:57] #/g/sicp agaric: Longlius, there is no such thing as milk chocolate, it's a ruse
[12-21 15:52:05] #/g/sicp Longlius: master ruse
[12-21 15:52:05] #/g/sicp agaric: well if there is, it's a lie
[12-21 15:52:13] #/g/sicp agaric: let me explain
[12-21 15:53:14] #/g/sicp agaric: we start with choco beans, we grind them and get 2 things, oils and the rest, the rest is the dark choco and the oils is the "milk" choco
[12-21 15:53:47] #/g/sicp Longlius: no, that's white chocolate
[12-21 15:54:01] #/g/sicp agaric: so 100% dark would be only the dark bits, and 100% "milk" would be the oils
[12-21 15:54:19] #/g/sicp agaric: that's the in old world at least
[12-21 15:54:32] #/g/sicp Longlius: chocolate comes from the new world
[12-21 15:54:47] #/g/sicp agaric: yes, but you need old world to refine it
[12-21 15:54:53] #/g/sicp agaric: think it of as work force

[12-21 23:04:03] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Trackpad? You know better than to use the mouse
[12-21 23:04:07] #/g/sicp |myth: I owned a mac before years ago
[12-21 23:04:13] #/g/sicp |myth: I liked it
[12-21 23:04:36] #/g/sicp Datsundere: LAMMJohnson, 1. you haven't used a "laptop"
[12-21 23:04:50] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Bullshit, I've had dozens of laptops
[12-21 23:04:53] #/g/sicp Datsundere: 2. you haven't used a macbook pro with retina/ips
[12-21 23:04:59] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes I have
[12-21 23:05:13] #/g/sicp |myth: rMBPs look nice.
[12-21 23:05:15] #/g/sicp |myth: So HD
[12-21 23:05:17] #/g/sicp |myth: many pixel
[12-21 23:05:32] #/g/sicp |myth: I just really hate laptops
[12-21 23:05:34] #/g/sicp |myth: Usually
[12-21 23:05:41] #/g/sicp |myth: I've had bad experiences with them
[12-21 23:05:51] #/g/sicp |myth: who knows maybe I'd like an MBA or rMBP
[12-21 23:05:54] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: People suck at buying laptops
[12-21 23:05:54] #/g/sicp Datsundere: rule 1. never buy hp
[12-21 23:06:11] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: People either get low-end shit or overheating nightmares
[12-21 23:06:43] #/g/sicp Datsundere: what brand do you recommend then lam
[12-21 23:06:49] #/g/sicp Datsundere: asus?
[12-21 23:06:56] #/g/sicp Datsundere: alienware?
[12-21 23:06:58] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes
[12-21 23:07:00] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Asus
[12-21 23:07:01] #/g/sicp Datsundere: ok
[12-21 23:07:09] #/g/sicp |myth: Dunno the macs at the apple store which are on all day seem kind of cool from the outside
[12-21 23:07:13] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Also Thinkpads
[12-21 23:07:20] #/g/sicp Datsundere: newer thinkpads are shit
[12-21 23:07:26] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Chinkpads
[12-21 23:07:28] #/g/sicp |myth: Soda is plebian tier
[12-21 23:07:29] #/g/sicp Datsundere: exactly
[12-21 23:07:35] #/g/sicp |myth: Ginger ale is master race
[12-21 23:07:48] #/g/sicp Datsundere: ginger ale is carbonated is it not?
[12-21 23:07:48] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: they're still much better than the competition
[12-21 23:07:54] #/g/sicp |myth: Datsundere, yep
[12-21 23:08:06] #/g/sicp |myth: Avoid the artificial ginger ales
[12-21 23:08:10] #/g/sicp |myth: Get the natural ones
[12-21 23:08:16] #/g/sicp Datsundere: I want vanilla coke
[12-21 23:08:24] #/g/sicp |myth: Fuck I have that too
[12-21 23:08:27] #/g/sicp |myth: Like ginger ale better
[12-21 23:08:47] #/g/sicp |myth: I don't like vanilla coke as much as I used to for some odd reason.
[12-21 23:08:57] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, 3>thinkpads
[12-21 23:09:02] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, 3>better than macs
[12-21 23:09:14] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: thinkpads have *always* been better than Macs
[12-21 23:09:15] #/g/sicp |myth: laughing_grills.aif
[12-21 23:09:46] #/g/sicp |myth: But they don't come with awesome things like iMovie, garage band, photo booth, or iWork
[12-21 23:09:59] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: ...
[12-21 23:10:16] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I didn't realise you were 13
[12-21 23:10:27] #/g/sicp |myth: 15 actually, le good sir
[12-21 23:10:35] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Oh, I see
[12-21 23:10:44] #/g/sicp |myth: Have we not been over this?
[12-21 23:11:27] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, you can never beat the MBA's battery life, lad
[12-21 23:11:32] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Sorry, I thought you were an adult who wanted a computer for adult things, not dicking about with your school friends
[12-21 23:12:02] #/g/sicp |myth: well durr, tell me when linux has a native facebook client and come back
[12-21 23:12:07] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: The upper limit of usefulness on long battery life is the amount of time you are ever away from a plug socket
[12-21 23:12:51] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I don't think I ever need more than 4 or 5 hours, although my Eee PC gets 10+
[12-21 23:12:57] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, I actually intend to use a Mac for everything I've used Linux for
[12-21 23:13:03] #/g/sicp |myth: Plus objective C development
[12-21 23:13:11] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Disgusting
[12-21 23:13:12] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Enjoy.
[12-21 23:13:21] #/g/sicp |myth: This netbook only gets 2 hours
[12-21 23:13:26] #/g/sicp |myth: But it's been dying lately
[12-21 23:13:35] #/g/sicp |myth: Linux's fault probably
[12-21 23:13:47] #/g/sicp |myth: its capacity started dropping ever since I started using ubuntu on it
[12-21 23:14:01] #/g/sicp |myth: Or it's just old
[12-21 23:14:16] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, what do you think about objective C?
[12-21 23:14:27] #/g/sicp |myth: I like its concept of messages and such
[12-21 23:15:35] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: It's actually not a bad addition to C
[12-21 23:15:45] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Syntax is ugly
[12-21 23:16:01] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Used extensively in making shit that I hate by faggots
[12-21 23:17:15] #/g/sicp |myth: The syntax looks odd I agree
[12-21 23:17:32] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Not odd
[12-21 23:17:33] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Ugly
[12-21 23:17:42] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, please tell me you don't follow the stereotype that all mac users are homosexual
[12-21 23:18:05] #/g/sicp |myth: Yes, ugly seems a bit more fitting
[12-21 23:21:30] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: |myth: the statistics are interesting
[12-21 23:21:39] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: If you use a Mac you are far more likely to be gay, anyway
[12-21 23:22:06] #/g/sicp |myth: Hehe
[12-21 23:22:19] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, I actually know a gay couple, they're dedicated mac users.
[12-21 23:22:34] #/g/sicp |myth: I didn't mention the stereotype to them though, that would be offensive
[12-21 23:23:07] #/g/sicp |myth: "once you go mac you never go back" one of them said.
[12-21 23:23:24] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/19/topless-snapchat-mom_n_4474243.html
[12-21 23:23:36] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I know lots of gay Mac users
[12-21 23:23:44] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: In fact, I know very few straight mac users
[12-21 23:24:24] #/g/sicp |myth: I hope you don't try to educate them about the values of your freedoms
[12-21 23:24:46] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: They know I disapprove of their toy computers
[12-21 23:25:09] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Also, not the value of my freedoms. The value of *their* freedoms.
[12-21 23:26:16] #/g/sicp |myth: ah
[12-21 23:26:24] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Normally if people ask me something along the lines of "how did you get so good with computers" I normally open by saying that I use an operating system and set of tools that allow me to change how my computer works
[12-21 23:26:45] #/g/sicp |myth: I'm pretty sure Linux was seen as a "toy OS" at some point as well ;)
[12-21 23:26:46] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Both Windows and OSX are terrible for this.
[12-21 23:26:58] #/g/sicp |myth: By the "professional" UNIX users.
[12-21 23:27:20] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I didn't use Linux when is was a toy OS
[12-21 23:27:24] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I used BSD
[12-21 23:27:28] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: And Sys-V
[12-21 23:27:43] #/g/sicp |myth: Then again that is only debated by fanboys of either side, and I'm not sure there were many UNIX fanboys
[12-21 23:27:53] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, NetBSD?
[12-21 23:28:12] #/g/sicp |myth: NetBSD had some impressive features in the 90s.
[12-21 23:28:28] #/g/sicp |myth: Like being able to run executables of non-NetBSD platforms.
[12-21 23:28:35] #/g/sicp |myth: Like SCO Xenix, SysV, etc...
[12-21 23:28:43] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: BSd 4.3
[12-21 23:28:51] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: NetBSD didn't exist then
[12-21 23:28:58] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I also used SunOS
[12-21 23:29:41] #/g/sicp |myth: Before 1993?
[12-21 23:29:44] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes
[12-21 23:29:55] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: By the time NetBSD was released Linux was no longer a toy
[12-21 23:35:29] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, what kind of Sun hardware did you use?
[12-21 23:36:24] #/g/sicp |myth: I'd think Linux would still be a "toy" to the UNIX world if it still lacked a networking stack and windowing system
[12-21 23:41:03] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: |myth: SPARCStation
[12-21 23:42:25] #/g/sicp |myth: Oh neat
[12-21 23:42:48] #/g/sicp chodesmoker: when did xfree86 bust onto the scene?
[12-21 23:43:01] #/g/sicp |myth: I'd feel terrible if I bought one of the older ones only to have it stop working completely a decade later
[12-21 23:43:20] #/g/sicp |myth: chodesmoker, dunno, but I know it was initially forked from X386
[12-21 23:43:42] #/g/sicp |myth: But then the maintainer decided to make X386 proprietary so xfree86 was born
[12-21 23:44:11] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Also I think GNU+Linux had a network stack and windowing system by 1993 but I can't find any references at the moment
[12-21 23:44:20] #/g/sicp |myth: No, it didn't.
[12-21 23:44:37] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: [citation needed]
[12-21 23:44:45] #/g/sicp |myth: Right back at you.
[12-21 23:45:01] #/g/sicp |myth: Linux was spawned in late 1992.
[12-21 23:45:06] #/g/sicp stupiddog: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwmJFfruFpg
[12-21 23:45:08] #/g/sicp |myth: No way a hobby OS would get X11 so fast.
[12-21 23:45:14] #/g/sicp stupiddog: #/g/sicp everyone
[12-21 23:45:36] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: |myth: Debian was released in 1993
[12-21 23:45:48] #/g/sicp |myth: yeah
[12-21 23:46:08] #/g/sicp chodesmoker: everything happened in 1993
[12-21 23:46:20] #/g/sicp chodesmoker: slackware, red hat
[12-21 23:46:42] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: ^
[12-21 23:46:50] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: GNU+Linux was fully functional in 1993
[12-21 23:47:11] #/g/sicp |myth: RedHat happened in 1994
[12-21 23:48:15] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: If there was a gap between the first NetBSD release and GNU+Linux getting full distributions it was tiny
[12-21 23:48:21] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: But I don't think it existed at all
[12-21 23:48:40] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: The OS was pretty much done. It just needed a kernel
[12-21 23:48:49] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: The networking stack, the windowing system...
[12-21 23:49:06] #/g/sicp |myth: 1993 is right
[12-21 23:50:03] #/g/sicp |myth: I thought Linux was first released in 1992, lord fuck my memory
[12-21 23:50:36] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I believe 1992 was the mailing list post announcing interest in writing a new kernel
[12-21 23:56:57] #/g/sicp |myth: LAMMJohnson, looked it up, august 25, 1991 was his first announcement
[12-22 00:00:36] #/g/sicp Datsundere: LAMMJohnson, have you seen stephen fry in america
[12-22 00:00:42] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes
[12-22 00:00:45] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Very funny
[12-22 00:01:21] #/g/sicp Datsundere: funny?
[12-22 00:01:57] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes
[12-22 00:02:04] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Stephen Fry is so good natured and wry
[12-22 00:08:50] #/g/sicp Datsundere: it's interesting that
[12-22 00:09:07] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Let me guess...
[12-22 00:09:08] #/g/sicp Datsundere: he says tehre are more "german american descendents" than "irish americans"
[12-22 00:09:19] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Americans don't get that he's being funny
[12-22 00:09:22] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Too dry
[12-22 00:09:31] #/g/sicp spock: better than too wet
[12-22 00:09:37] #/g/sicp Datsundere: rekt
[12-22 00:10:43] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I wrote a 99% complete Midi writing implementation in 184 LOC
[12-22 00:10:51] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: https://github.com/JohnAnthony/midi-go/blob/master/midi.go
[12-22 00:11:18] #/g/sicp spock: what songs have you done
[12-22 00:11:31] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Actually, I'm interested in writing music algorithmically
[12-22 00:11:45] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition
[12-22 00:11:54] #/g/sicp spock: like bach?
[12-22 00:12:13] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes, Bach is well known for having a heuristic to his musical approach
[12-22 00:12:15] #/g/sicp Datsundere: hsom.pdf
[12-22 00:16:05] #/g/sicp neonfuz: are there any naming conventions for functions in c
[12-22 00:16:17] #/g/sicp neonfuz: like do people use cammel caps, or underscores
[12-22 00:17:18] #/g/sicp chodesmoker: dontUseJava.namingConventions.seriouslyJustUseUnderscores
[12-22 00:20:56] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Constants are ALLCAPS
[12-22 00:21:06] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Functions are_with_underscores()
[12-22 00:21:15] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Variables are short like s
[12-22 00:21:46] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: If your variable with a consise name is not understandable your function is probably too big
[12-22 00:23:52] #/g/sicp neonfuz: k, I knew about the ALLCAPS
[12-22 00:24:12] #/g/sicp neonfuz: well at least I knew to make defines ALLCAPS, but things I define with const should be too?
[12-22 00:24:36] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes
[12-22 00:25:02] #/g/sicp neonfuz: k thanks
[12-22 00:25:41] #/g/sicp chodesmoker: r-real men use hungarian notation

[12-22 13:06:15] #/g/sicp naosia: That was 2 days after launch though
[12-22 13:06:31] #/g/sicp bas_: naosia: I can ask him if wants to sell your doge
[12-22 13:06:38] #/g/sicp naosia: I don't have any liquid right now
[12-22 13:06:45] #/g/sicp bas_: he's really good at doing business
[12-22 13:06:50] #/g/sicp naosia: It's tied up elsewhere at the moment
[12-22 13:06:54] #/g/sicp bas_: he can manage to sell anything for a profit 
[12-22 13:07:12] #/g/sicp bas_: just tell me when you have some doge you want to sell and I'll hook you up with him
[12-22 13:07:34] #/g/sicp naosia: Alright
[12-22 13:10:55] #/g/sicp naosia: Anyone decent with perl here?
[12-22 13:11:27] #/g/sicp bas_: ugh perl
[12-22 13:11:44] #/g/sicp naosia: I just need a quick irssi script
[12-22 13:11:46] #/g/sicp naosia: It's just a regex
[12-22 13:11:49] #/g/sicp bas_: never really liked perl 
[12-22 13:11:51] #/g/sicp naosia: But I'm bad with both regex and perl
[12-22 13:11:52] #/g/sicp naosia: so yeah
[12-22 13:12:00] #/g/sicp bas_: naosia: doesn't irssi also run python
[12-22 13:12:04] #/g/sicp naosia: not afaik
[12-22 13:12:11] #/g/sicp ing: bas_: to criticize a programming language you should first master at least one :)
[12-22 13:12:11] #/g/sicp bas_: I'm pretty good with regex if you need something matched
[12-22 13:12:12] #/g/sicp naosia: You're thinking of xchat
[12-22 13:12:15] #/g/sicp ing: perl has its applications
[12-22 13:12:28] #/g/sicp naosia: bas_, I just want to match a dogecoin address
[12-22 13:12:35] #/g/sicp bas_: ing: I know but I never really got into it. It just looks like one big mess of stuff I don't understand to me
[12-22 13:12:37] #/g/sicp naosia: D[0-9a-zA-Z].{32}
[12-22 13:12:42] #/g/sicp naosia: and kick anyone who posts one
[12-22 13:12:46] #/g/sicp mcef: What's a doge address like?
[12-22 13:12:47] #/g/sicp bas_: hahah
[12-22 13:13:04] #/g/sicp mcef: Also, make sicpbot module.
[12-22 13:13:14] #/g/sicp naosia: sicpbot isn't on freenode
[12-22 13:13:56] #/g/sicp mcef: Oh.
[12-22 13:14:06] #/g/sicp mcef: Write a bot in pure bash that does that.
[12-22 13:14:24] #/g/sicp mcef: Do a system() call from perl.
[12-22 13:15:29] #/g/sicp ing: naosia: http://pastebin.com/M6beYUE3
[12-22 13:15:41] #/g/sicp ing: you can probably figure out how to tweak it
[12-22 13:15:42] #/g/sicp bas_: I wonder if I'm still v-lined from freenode
[12-22 13:16:04] #/g/sicp naosia: Thanks
[12-22 13:17:23] #/g/sicp the_pig: mcef: stop trying to spread your madness
[12-22 13:17:36] #/g/sicp bas_: insanity
[12-22 13:21:04] #/g/sicp naosia: Oh go
[12-22 13:21:18] #/g/sicp naosia: Oh god ing
[12-22 13:21:22] #/g/sicp naosia: It matched like everything
[12-22 13:21:38] #/g/sicp naosia: Kicked 4 people before I had the chance to unload the script
[12-22 13:21:43] #/g/sicp bas_: hahahaha
[12-22 13:21:44] #/g/sicp SICPBot: ( )  / / 
[12-22 13:21:48] #/g/sicp ing: fix you regex :s
[12-22 13:22:04] #/g/sicp naosia: Yu
[12-22 13:22:05] #/g/sicp naosia: p
[12-22 13:22:43] #/g/sicp bas_: mcef: What are some good python irc libraries or am I better off writing on myself?
[12-22 13:27:17] #/g/sicp naosia: ing, regex seems to work fine :V
[12-22 13:27:40] #/g/sicp naosia: Do I need anything specific with perl?
[12-22 13:28:44] #/g/sicp ing: m/[0-9a-zA-Z].{32}/i
[12-22 13:28:48] #/g/sicp ing: should work fine
[12-22 13:28:56] #/g/sicp naosia: Ah, ok
[12-22 13:28:57] #/g/sicp naosia: Thanks
[12-22 13:29:15] #/g/sicp ing: i is probably redundant (case insensitivity)
[12-22 13:29:39] #/g/sicp bas_: ign yea was just about to say that it's redundant
[12-22 13:30:24] #/g/sicp bas_: also why not m/[\w\d]{32}/
[12-22 13:30:27] #/g/sicp ing: included it out of habit
[12-22 13:30:32] #/g/sicp bas_: you are matching the wildcard with .
[12-22 13:30:42] #/g/sicp bas_: aka any char
[12-22 13:30:42] #/g/sicp ing: because i just repasted what naosia posted earlier
[12-22 13:30:49] #/g/sicp bas_: well the . should be gone
[12-22 13:30:59] #/g/sicp ing: k
[12-22 13:31:02] #/g/sicp ing: you're right
[12-22 13:35:04] #/g/sicp bas_: Doing the vim tutor atm. I can now see why people prefer vim
[12-22 13:35:13] #/g/sicp bas_: No clue why I didn't learn vim sooner
[12-22 13:43:25] #/g/sicp mcef: bas_: No idea, I wrote one myself.
[12-22 13:43:27] #/g/sicp mcef: the_pig: No.
[12-22 13:43:59] #/g/sicp bas_: mcef: in python? You mean sicpbot?
[12-22 13:44:05] #/g/sicp mcef: No, I mean lambdairc.
[12-22 13:44:11] #/g/sicp mcef: But it's too beautiful for something like this.
[12-22 13:44:17] #/g/sicp bas_: hahaha
[12-22 13:44:28] #/g/sicp mcef: It's that sedbot used before I rewrote it in bash.
[12-22 13:45:46] #/g/sicp mcef: ing: Wouldn't that regex match any line starting with an alphanumeric characters and being at least 33 characters long?
[12-22 13:46:05] #/g/sicp bas_: aready pointed that out
[12-22 13:46:10] #/g/sicp mcef: Oh.
[12-22 13:55:39] #/g/sicp the_pig: mcef looks on, and he sees the Java programmers beg for mercy, and he whispers: "No."
[12-22 13:56:15] #/g/sicp bas_: I used to be a java programmer. It was my first programming language. 
[12-22 13:56:18] #/g/sicp bas_: terrible mistake
[12-22 13:56:28] #/g/sicp the_pig: I think C was mine
[12-22 13:58:04] #/g/sicp bas_: :btc
[12-22 13:58:06] #/g/sicp bas_: :ltc
[12-22 13:58:45] #/g/sicp mcef: Java was mine too.
[12-22 13:58:56] #/g/sicp mcef: I wrote very beautiful Java[1].

[12-22 13:59:30] #/g/sicp mcef: [1] http://pastebin.com/EBDa8Msg

[12-22 14:00:41] #/g/sicp mcef: 55-56 are close.
[12-22 14:00:47] #/g/sicp bas_: sicpbot add quote <the_pig> mcef looks on, and he sees the Java programmers beg for mercy, and he whispers: "No."
[12-22 14:00:52] #/g/sicp bas_: ugh
[12-22 14:01:06] #/g/sicp bas_: mcef: that code makes my soul bleed
[12-22 14:01:27] #/g/sicp mcef: syntax: sicpbot[:,]? quote <$user> $message
[12-22 14:01:39] #/g/sicp bas_: sicpbot, quote <the_pig> mcef looks on, and he sees the Java programmers beg for mercy, and he whispers: "No."
[12-22 14:01:39] #/g/sicp SICPBot: Quote recorded
[12-22 14:01:44] #/g/sicp bas_: thanks
[12-22 14:02:49] #/g/sicp mcef: bas_: You know that java code?
[12-22 14:02:54] #/g/sicp mcef: Compile it
[12-22 14:03:08] #/g/sicp mcef: Usage: java enterprise.Main /path/to/source.java [/path/to/output.java]
[12-22 14:03:30] #/g/sicp mcef: Without output, it'll write to stdout. Without input, it'll read from stdin.
[12-22 14:03:34] #/g/sicp mcef: And it expects valid Java.
[12-22 14:03:59] #/g/sicp mcef: Also, this is the slightly broken version.
[12-22 14:04:27] #/g/sicp bas_: mcef: I made it prettier
[12-22 14:04:29] #/g/sicp bas_: http://pastebin.com/c2AP3thQ
[12-22 14:04:36] #/g/sicp mcef: Meh
[12-22 14:04:43] #/g/sicp mcef: You don't see the blocks now.
[12-22 14:04:58] #/g/sicp bas_: Funny that my php minifier also works on c-like/ish languages
[12-22 14:05:02] #/g/sicp mcef: The purpose of that style was to get rid of the clutter (such as indentation, braces and semicolons).
[12-22 14:05:12] #/g/sicp the_pig: 3>clutter
[12-22 14:05:13] #/g/sicp mcef: Left-aligned, it flows like a book, not like someone just threw the code all around.
[12-22 14:05:30] #/g/sicp mcef: Anyway, bas_, run your minified version through itself.
[12-22 14:05:31] #/g/sicp bas_: mcef: what does it even do
[12-22 14:05:34] #/g/sicp mcef: ^^
[12-22 14:06:07] #/g/sicp bas_: first tell me what it does :/
[12-22 14:06:34] #/g/sicp the_pig: It probably just spits out code formatted like that
[12-22 14:06:43] #/g/sicp mcef: Reads it input (or the file specified in argv[1]), does stuff to it and writes it to output (or the file specified in argv[2])
[12-22 14:08:12] #/g/sicp bas_: let me install a jdk first
[12-22 14:08:36] #/g/sicp Longlius: who's installing a jdk now
[12-22 14:08:38] #/g/sicp Longlius: don't do it man
[12-22 14:08:53] #/g/sicp bas_: "You have so much to live for"
[12-22 14:09:09] #/g/sicp Longlius: of course, it also depends on which JDK you're installing
[12-22 14:09:21] #/g/sicp bas_: openjdk\
[12-22 14:09:22] #/g/sicp mcef: I use opendjk

[12-22 14:10:16] #/g/sicp Longlius: make sure it's in your PATH

[12-22 15:18:42] #/g/sicp |myth: What?
[12-22 15:19:00] #/g/sicp |myth: By suggesting you join #/g/technology by accident?
[12-22 15:19:41] #/g/sicp |myth: Archmage, bas_, sorry if you interpreted that as spam, I don't have an autojoin so I join all my channels manually.
[12-22 15:19:48] #/g/sicp Archmage: #/g/technology is the lowest you can go
[12-22 15:19:50] #/g/sicp |myth: I made a typo and forgot to ass a /
[12-22 15:19:58] #/g/sicp mcef: Why do you even quit irc?
[12-22 15:20:06] #/g/sicp |myth: Yeah, it has its fair share of faggots
[12-22 15:20:25] #/g/sicp |myth: mcef, my laptop gets really hot after long hours
[12-22 15:20:40] #/g/sicp |myth: And it has a bright LED I'm too lazy to cover up
[12-22 15:21:05] #/g/sicp |myth: I remember when I ran gentoo on this thing; never again
[12-22 15:21:14] #/g/sicp |myth: My keyboard could fry an egg

[12-22 15:26:57] #/g/sicp mcef: |myth: Get a VPS
[12-22 15:27:02] #/g/sicp mcef: Or a home server

[12-22 15:29:28] #/g/sicp mcef: I got both.
[12-22 15:29:44] #/g/sicp mcef: I run the znc on the vpn and the irssi on the server.
[12-22 15:30:11] #/g/sicp mcef: To which I ssh through 1-3 other computers.
[12-22 15:30:18] #/g/sicp psycho: is it a headless server ?
[12-22 15:30:46] #/g/sicp mcef: No GUI on servers.
[12-22 15:31:16] #/g/sicp psycho: headless, as in no monitor (+kb) attached to it
[12-22 15:31:26] #/g/sicp psycho: i mean
[12-22 15:31:29] #/g/sicp mcef: The home server has a broken monitor and a keyboard.
[12-22 15:31:29] #/g/sicp Archmage: But they do have mice
[12-22 15:31:30] #/g/sicp Archmage: ( )
[12-22 15:31:34] #/g/sicp mcef: But I don't use them.
[12-22 15:31:37] #/g/sicp mcef: It's an old netbook.
[12-22 15:31:50] #/g/sicp mcef: The only button I use is the reboot one.
[12-22 15:32:02] #/g/sicp psycho: are you ssh-ing into a home server just to use an irc client, instead of running in locally like any other normal human being 
[12-22 15:32:04] #/g/sicp mcef: When I manage to accidentally disconnect the hard drive.
[12-22 15:32:13] #/g/sicp the_pig: psycho: Who the hell runs IRC locally
[12-22 15:32:14] #/g/sicp mcef: Why would I run the client locally?
[12-22 15:32:19] #/g/sicp the_pig: tmux all day
[12-22 15:32:24] #/g/sicp mcef: dtach here
[12-22 15:32:25] #/g/sicp mcef: Or screen
[12-22 15:32:27] #/g/sicp the_pig: SCUM
[12-22 15:32:38] #/g/sicp Rylee: >screen
[12-22 15:32:43] #/g/sicp mcef: Mostly just dtach
[12-22 15:32:54] #/g/sicp mcef: Because debian screen has idiotic limitations.
[12-22 15:33:03] #/g/sicp the_pig: Not enough lambdas for you?
[12-22 15:33:08] #/g/sicp Rylee: 2013 and not using tmux
[12-22 15:33:14] #/g/sicp the_pig: 2012 + 1
[12-22 15:33:19] #/g/sicp mcef: Why would you use tmux instead of dtach?
[12-22 15:33:41] #/g/sicp psycho: it's prettier
[12-22 15:33:45] #/g/sicp Rylee: because you want a terminal multipleer and not a terminal singleplexer

[12-23 18:59:27] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: Firstly
[12-23 18:59:45] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: dogecoin isn't popular just because people like doge
[12-23 19:00:02] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: It's mainly popular because most of the people who use it are just buttmad that they missed out on bitcoin
[12-23 19:00:41] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: Also, I realised that if I were to get filthy rich, I would give a large chunk of my money to the FSF, EFF and Wikipedia

[12-23 19:01:38] #/g/sicp phrodo: doge is successful because people like doge
[12-23 19:02:05] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: That's ONE reason
[12-23 19:02:10] #/g/sicp phrodo: compared to fedoracoin or BBQcoin people dont like those
[12-23 19:02:48] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: Eh
[12-23 19:02:56] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: I have no interest in mining dogecoins
[12-23 19:03:07] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: phrodo: Did you build a computer just to mine coins?

[12-23 22:12:11] #/g/sicp |myth: http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/virusscan-enterprise-for-linux.aspx
[12-23 22:12:24] #/g/sicp |myth: tfw you realize almost all modern antiviruses also have linux versions
[12-23 22:13:10] #/g/sicp phrodo: man i just have microsoft security essentials
[12-23 22:13:49] #/g/sicp |myth: I saw a recent report which proves MSE misses something like 29% of all viruses.
[12-23 22:14:21] #/g/sicp phrodo: the best sucurity are the firefox addons 
[12-23 22:14:36] #/g/sicp phrodo: and just not downloading maclicious software
[12-23 22:14:52] #/g/sicp |myth: phrodo, that doesn't protect against computer worms.
[12-23 22:15:07] #/g/sicp phrodo: man how do you get worms
[12-23 22:15:14] #/g/sicp |myth: Through your network.
[12-23 22:15:32] #/g/sicp phrodo: i c im not connected to a network
[12-23 22:15:35] #/g/sicp |myth: They use vulnerabilities in your operating system or router and intrude your computer without you noticing
[12-23 22:15:48] #/g/sicp |myth: phrodo, you're on the internet, so you're on a network.
[12-23 22:15:56] #/g/sicp phrodo: what
[12-23 22:16:03] #/g/sicp |myth: internet, internetwork
[12-23 22:16:12] #/g/sicp |myth: Are you retarded?
[12-23 22:16:15] #/g/sicp phrodo: man MAN
[12-23 22:16:39] #/g/sicp Prier: Do you guys know of any programs that automatically replace things that you type with predefined strings or such? Something so that <3 becomes  and such
[12-23 22:16:56] #/g/sicp |myth: Worms have been a prevalent threat since 1988 when the Morris Worm appeared
[12-23 22:17:08] #/g/sicp phrodo: i dont think i've ever gotten a worm
[12-23 22:17:35] #/g/sicp |myth: You don't know
[12-23 22:17:37] #/g/sicp Prier: I like how "|myth" is talking about the dangers of computer worms, its rather fitting 
[12-23 22:17:52] #/g/sicp |myth: Prier, you sound like you're denying they exist.
[12-23 22:18:09] #/g/sicp Prier: oh no they are indeed a thing but I don't think any of us are really at risk...
[12-23 22:18:21] #/g/sicp spock: Users need to be wary of opening unexpected email,[12] and should not run attached files or programs, or visit web sites that are linked to such emails.
[12-23 22:18:30] #/g/sicp |myth: Computer worms are probably the most dangerous kinds of malicious software
[12-23 22:18:48] #/g/sicp |myth: Like that stuxnet one, which is designed to fuck up nuclear reactors
[12-23 22:18:56] #/g/sicp spock: that was uploaded by USB
[12-23 22:19:02] #/g/sicp |myth: Or Conficker
[12-23 22:19:09] #/g/sicp |myth: spock, it can also enter through the network.
[12-23 22:19:26] #/g/sicp spock: no i meant the stuxnet they used a usb to infect the iranian nuclear intranet
[12-23 22:19:45] #/g/sicp |myth: I wonder how they got the USB in there
[12-23 22:20:03] #/g/sicp spock: spies
[12-23 22:20:07] #/g/sicp |myth: I highly doubt they let americans in their nuclear facilities and drop USB drives
[12-23 22:20:28] #/g/sicp spock: yea man they probably have an iranian spy working as a scientist
[12-23 22:20:39] #/g/sicp Prier: well then |myth what can we do to defend against these dangerous worms? don't just be a doomsayer, help us
[12-23 22:20:40] #/g/sicp |myth: Probably.
[12-23 22:20:48] #/g/sicp |myth: Seems kind of risky either way.
[12-23 22:21:01] #/g/sicp spock: just dont open malicious content Prier 
[12-23 22:21:10] #/g/sicp |myth: Prier, antivirii, using an operating system better immune to most worms.
[12-23 22:21:33] #/g/sicp |myth: Blocking ports
[12-23 22:21:44] #/g/sicp |myth: Not being retarded
[12-23 22:21:45] #/g/sicp Prier: does blocking ports really help if there is no application set to receive data on them?
[12-23 22:21:57] #/g/sicp spock: ima lie down for abit
[12-23 22:22:14] #/g/sicp |myth: Prier, what? You mean if there is no application listening on a port?
[12-23 22:22:19] #/g/sicp Prier: yea
[12-23 22:22:28] #/g/sicp |myth: I'm not sure what you mean.

[12-23 22:23:49] #/g/sicp |myth: Netflix runs FreeBSD on their servers

[12-23 22:24:38] #/g/sicp |myth: 3>HURR BSD LICENSE MEANS ALL MODIFICATIONS WILL BE PROPRIETARY

[12-24 06:06:47] #/g/sicp Guest30973: Asus anti surge protection feature does this quite often, without there actually beeing a problem. The motherboard cant even measure the incoming voltages reliably, so the feature is very unreliable.
[12-24 06:06:47] #/g/sicp Guest30973: Disabling the feature in the bios will fix your problem.

[12-24 08:19:49] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: It wouldn't be for me to uphold such a (sensible) policy, seeing as I'm planning to leave Rizon in the New Year,

[12-24 08:40:30] #/g/sicp Tadpole: But do you really feel you need to leave? You can find some more programming-related channels to get your discussion fix.
[12-24 08:40:43] #/g/sicp Tadpole: And you'd still have us for that very nice informal atmosphere.
[12-24 08:42:14] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I'll be honest, a discussion I had with chown yesterday cemented my decision to leave rather than background this channel

[12-24 08:46:34] #/g/sicp Tadpole: Can't say I really disagree with you there. luz wasn't responsible enough and BradPitt is a perpetual troll.
[12-24 08:46:36] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: There's been some interesting programming discussion in here
[12-24 08:47:01] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: Also Shiz was grumpy.
[12-24 08:47:03] #/g/sicp Tadpole: chchjesus_: It's more of an exception than a rule, while this still is a self-described programming channel.
[12-24 08:47:08] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I like Freenode's mdoeration style
[12-24 08:47:49] #/g/sicp Tadpole: So you're going to cut ties with all of us, LAMMJohnson?
[12-24 08:48:23] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I was having that discussion with redlizard last night.
[12-24 08:48:24] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: Shiz was nofunallowed.jpg
[12-24 08:48:31] #/g/sicp Tadpole: I really will miss you, you and redlizard have taught me a lot here.
[12-24 08:49:24] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I don't know what to suggest. I obviously don't want to completely cut off contact with everyone.
[12-24 08:49:59] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: the only option was to suggest a new Freenode channel, but I didn't really want to suggest it as it felt a bit like poaching for members.
[12-24 08:50:45] #/g/sicp Tadpole: LAMMJohnson: Fair enough.
[12-24 08:52:18] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I'll consider it further. redlizard was obviously heartbroken by the implication that he wouldn't have me to argue with any more.
[12-24 08:52:51] #/g/sicp psycho: this feels like lammy's gonna die

[12-24 08:56:03] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: People are a little harsh with their standards on this channel though
[12-24 08:56:27] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: 03>not 100% programming discussion, therefore they don't discuss programming at all

[12-24 08:58:46] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: But, you are obviously allowed to leave at your discretion, LAMMJohnson.
[12-24 08:59:00] #/g/sicp chchjesus_: Was it BradPitt or chown that delivered the final deciding blow?

[12-25 08:13:13] #/g/sicp bas_: Do any of you guys know how to set the distance from the lft of the line numbers in vim?
[12-25 08:13:17] #/g/sicp bas_: (kinda new to vim)
[12-25 08:13:30] #/g/sicp bas_: Also how do I enable syntax highlighting
[12-25 08:13:59] #/g/sicp dd: For the latter, put 'syntax on' in your .vimrc
[12-25 08:14:12] #/g/sicp bas_: I have it set to on
[12-25 08:14:22] #/g/sicp bas_: first question: http://i.imgur.com/UDHME8M.png
[12-25 08:15:23] #/g/sicp dd: I don't know the answer to that one

[12-25 08:16:34] #/g/sicp bas_: guides :< I'm new to vim
[12-25 08:16:47] #/g/sicp dd: Because vim does it automagically depending on the extension or the shebang
[12-25 08:17:06] #/g/sicp dd: shebang being #!/usr/bin/env python2.7 for example
[12-25 08:17:24] #/g/sicp trist4n: thats definitely a shebang

[12-25 13:45:37] #/g/sicp Lolimania: Where can I find rizon logs?
[12-25 13:45:40] #/g/sicp Tadpole: It would pop in random channels every now and then, look for words like "bomb" or "encryption", say that whoever said that got flagged as a potential terrorist, and report back to #nsa
[12-25 13:45:49] #/g/sicp Tadpole: Which is a private channel.
[12-25 13:46:07] #/g/sicp Tadpole: It was pretty cool.

[12-26 14:02:54] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Welcome, LAMMJohnson.
[12-26 14:03:10] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Hello, all.
[12-26 14:03:10] #/g/sicp naosia: yo chown
[12-26 14:03:18] #/g/sicp naosia: What mumble are you guys on now?
[12-26 14:03:20] #/g/sicp naosia: Hey LAMMJohnson 
[12-26 14:03:25] #/g/sicp naosia: People told me you were gone for good!
[12-26 14:03:35] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I will be soon
[12-26 14:03:45] #/g/sicp naosia: Oh. :(
[12-26 14:03:48] #/g/sicp naosia: How so?
[12-26 14:04:53] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: naosia: This channel still doesn't really reflect my interests, even after 3 years
[12-26 14:05:23] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I thought I'd shake things up and try to find somehwere that's a better fit
[12-26 14:05:35] #/g/sicp naosia: Fair enough.
[12-26 14:05:38] #/g/sicp naosia: So where are you headed?
[12-26 14:05:40] #/g/sicp naosia: Freenode?
[12-26 14:05:47] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Yes, Freenode and OFTC
[12-26 14:06:02] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: This is the only rizon channel I've ever found even remotely interesting
[12-26 14:06:09] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: So, frankly, fuck Rizon
[12-26 14:06:16] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Rizon is an awful network.
[12-26 14:06:26] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: The 4chan is always strong here
[12-26 14:06:29] #/g/sicp chchjesus: It's mainly all the same people on the channels.
[12-26 14:06:38] #/g/sicp naosia: In terms of network quality, Freenode is even worse.
[12-26 14:06:43] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I also like Freenode's moderation style
[12-26 14:06:51] #/g/sicp naosia: But channel quality is far higher.
[12-26 14:07:04] #/g/sicp naosia: What, fascism?
[12-26 14:07:05] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: And the average age seems to be a little higher
[12-26 14:07:14] #/g/sicp naosia: That's my impression of the freenode moderation, anyway.
[12-26 14:07:31] #/g/sicp qb: I thought you euros loved fascism
[12-26 14:07:36] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: naosia: Orfficial channels are on-topic and that's enforced. Which is good.
[12-26 14:07:51] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: s/Orf/Of/
[12-26 14:07:51] #/g/sicp sed: <LAMMJohnson> naosia: Official channels are on-topic and that's enforced. Which is good.
[12-26 14:08:04] #/g/sicp naosia: Yeah, I agree.
[12-26 14:08:24] #/g/sicp naosia: Well, to some extent.
[12-26 14:08:27] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: And the default style is to have nobody showing overt OP status
[12-26 14:08:34] #/g/sicp chchjesus: ^
[12-26 14:08:53] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Some people still do show it by giving themselves voice though.
[12-26 14:09:13] #/g/sicp naosia: I think it should be up to the channel in question to enforce that, but whatever works I guess.
[12-26 14:09:40] #/g/sicp naosia: Freenode is still a horrible network when it comes to actual network quality though.
[12-26 14:09:47] #/g/sicp naosia: I mean, they have more netsplits than Rizon.
[12-26 14:10:07] #/g/sicp chchjesus: What's OFTC like?
[12-26 14:10:13] #/g/sicp Rylee: they're also under insane amounts more DoS attack than Rizon
[12-26 14:10:22] #/g/sicp naosia: True.
[12-26 14:10:23] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I've only ever been to both Rizon and Freenode
[12-26 14:10:39] #/g/sicp naosia: I like Espernet.
[12-26 14:10:47] #/g/sicp Rylee: straight up, you know freenode nodes have to be able to take something like 10Gbps constantly to be considered for linking
[12-26 14:10:47] #/g/sicp naosia: Haven't been there since early 2012 though.
[12-26 14:10:48] #/g/sicp Rylee: or something like that
[12-26 14:11:12] #/g/sicp Rylee: 24/7/365
[12-26 14:11:14] #/g/sicp Rylee: crazy shit
[12-26 14:11:17] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Rylee: Crazy.
[12-26 14:11:28] #/g/sicp naosia: Rylee: Wow, didn't know it was that bad.
[12-26 14:11:40] #/g/sicp naosia: Disregard what I said earlier then.
[12-26 14:11:44] #/g/sicp naosia: That's impressive.
[12-26 14:11:56] #/g/sicp Rylee: yeah, it's why most nodes are donated by big companies
[12-26 14:11:59] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: chchjesus: OFTC is pretty good. It's very similar to Freenode in channel content
[12-26 14:12:08] #/g/sicp Rylee: or datacenters
[12-26 14:12:17] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I see.
[12-26 14:12:36] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I might look at other networks and expand my interests and experiences
[12-26 14:17:31] #/g/sicp chchjesus: naosia: Perhaps, instead of grepping your logs, you could run the database query instead?
[12-26 14:17:40] #/g/sicp chchjesus: hue
[12-26 14:18:06] #/g/sicp naosia: cba
[12-26 14:18:07] #/g/sicp naosia: sorry
[12-26 14:18:25] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Das cool
[12-26 14:18:55] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I wrote a Scheme interpreter in the time die Hard 3 was on this morning.
[12-26 14:19:27] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I'm interested in writing a Go Emacs with pure Go R5Rs Scheme implementation.
[12-26 14:20:26] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Go R5R?
[12-26 14:20:51] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: R5RS Scheme
[12-26 14:21:20] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Interesting.
[12-26 14:21:36] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I really should start writing LISP code again. It's been a while.
[12-26 14:21:41] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: There are some interesting challenges in writing a proper Scheme interpreter
[12-26 14:22:00] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Little things like getting TCO correct
[12-26 14:22:08] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: In a language like go which doesn't have TCO
[12-26 14:22:25] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Tiny-Scheme and Mini-Scheme are both excellent reads
[12-26 14:22:25] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Aw
[12-26 14:22:46] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I had trouble getting the datastructures down until I looked at both of those and took the time to sketch them out
[12-26 14:23:02] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I like Golang. I didn't realise it didn't have TCO.
[12-26 14:23:08] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Perhaps it will get it in the future.
[12-26 14:23:12] #/g/sicp chown: what is TCO
[12-26 14:23:17] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Tail Call Optimisation
[12-26 14:23:18] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Tail Call Optimisation
[12-26 14:23:24] #/g/sicp Datsundere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHdWoWLcRw
[12-26 14:23:43] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I looked at several discussions on TCO in Go and the concensus seemed to be "maybe never"
[12-26 14:23:59] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Oh? What was the reasoning?
[12-26 14:24:28] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Also I love how Golang is essentially C with garbage collection, closures and proper concurrency
[12-26 14:24:58] #/g/sicp chown: I got an email once telling me I was within the top 100 Go programmers
[12-26 14:25:18] #/g/sicp chown: this was like over a year and a half ago so I assume I was just the 100th person to actually code in Go
[12-26 14:25:50] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Neat.
[12-26 14:25:56] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: chchjesus: I guess it's just not a priority
[12-26 14:26:36] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: TCO seems to exist in some cases anyway, but it's not guaranteed and it seems to be more because the underlying tools handle it rather than because Go has been designed for it
[12-26 14:28:17] #/g/sicp chchjesus: I'm bent on trying to convince our team at work on using it for some of the data analysis we will do later on, but we're running node.js on Amazon's distributed computing servers
[12-26 14:28:28] #/g/sicp chchjesus: So I see it as unlikely
[12-26 14:29:09] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Their old company was also one of Google's competitors in the advertising market, so there may be a small bit of bias.
[12-26 14:29:28] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: 3>competing with Google in advertising
[12-26 14:30:02] #/g/sicp chchjesus: They actually, at one point, had more people served with their ads
[12-26 14:30:05] #/g/sicp chchjesus: for a short period of time
[12-26 14:30:10] #/g/sicp chchjesus: But then Google reclaimed it
[12-26 14:31:34] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: There's something really special about the first time your interpreter returns a non-trivial value
[12-26 14:32:06] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: (define square (lambda (x) (* x x))) (square 4)
[12-26 14:32:07] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: |> 16

[12-26 14:34:01] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Because Rob Pike
[12-26 14:35:03] #/g/sicp chchjesus: Of course

[12-26 15:09:20] #/g/sicp Datsundere: are there any women savants?
[12-26 15:10:20] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Savantism is extremely rare amongst women.
[12-26 15:10:48] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: 3> An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.
[12-26 15:13:01] #/g/sicp Datsundere: ah
[12-26 15:13:31] #/g/sicp Lolimania: >autistic relative
[12-26 15:14:04] #/g/sicp Lolimania: his mom is making him take therapy or something
[12-26 15:14:19] #/g/sicp Lolimania: supposedly some girls come and talk to him or some shit
[12-26 15:14:20] #/g/sicp Macbot: I decided to come here and talk about the Pokes.
[12-26 15:14:27] #/g/sicp Lolimania: never really got how that's supposed to help anyone
[12-26 15:14:43] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: You need to think more like women
[12-26 15:14:54] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: That will make you a more well-rounded person
[12-26 15:14:59] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: (Yeah right)
[12-26 15:19:45] #/g/sicp Lolimania: LAMMJohnson: i don't get many therapies in  general
[12-26 15:20:03] #/g/sicp Lolimania: unless it hinders daily activity or something
[12-26 15:23:15] #/g/sicp BradPitt: LAMMJohnson

[12-26 15:27:08] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I've also been working on some interesting stuff for working with Midi streaming and files

[12-26 16:28:51] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: I want a pure Go scheme so that I can write a nice Go Emacs
[12-26 16:29:05] #/g/sicp the_pig: Well, I hope you learn something
[12-26 16:29:28] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Learning all day every day like a boss
[12-26 16:32:26] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: What I would ideally like at the end of it is a fantastically customisable text editor
[12-26 16:32:46] #/g/sicp LAMMJohnson: Written in Go rather than C and using Scheme rather than Emacs Lisp
